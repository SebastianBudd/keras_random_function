# tensorflow_random_function
A project to start learning tensorflow. 

It contains code to randomly generate a function of one variable containg sine, cosine, cubic, quadratic and linear terms which is used to create a noisy data set. 
It also contains a keras neural network script which approximates the original function using the data.

The image Keras_function_approximation is a plot of showing the original function as a red curve, the noisy data as blue markers and the neural network approximation as a green curve.
